### 👨‍💻 Engineering Philosophy

I am a Senior Engineer focused on designing high-performance backends and cloud-native infrastructures. My work is guided by the pursuit of **Clean Code** and **Maintainable Architecture**, ensuring that complex systems remain scalable and robust. 

As a **Tryton Open Source Activist**, I contribute to building modular, reliable software ecosystems. Beyond the code, I apply the same architectural precision to fermentation as a **BJCP Mead Judge**, finding the perfect intersection between chemistry, craft, and technical complexity.
